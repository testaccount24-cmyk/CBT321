     This is my contribution to CBT. I like the idea behind CBT and
     like to say a big "Thank you" to Sam Golob for his support and
     Gilbert Saint-Flour for giving me access to his P/390.

     A big "Thank you" to Tom Ross from IBM helping in order to
     get the Enterprise Cobol stuff working or other questions.

     It is distributed on an as is, where is basis, without expressed
     or implied warranty of any kind. It is distributed in hope that
     it may save other members of the project some wheel re-inventing.

     A big "Thank you" to Steve Stocker from CSC for his
     enhancements.

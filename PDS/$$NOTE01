Note from Sam Golob....

This version was supplied to me by John Loch, who had it directly
from Roland Schiradin.  It must have fallen through the cracks, if
and when Roland sent it to me.  Since what John had, was later than
what I had, I asked him to send it to me, so everyone could (finally)
benefit from it.

I checked my emails from that time, and it seems that Roland never
sent this version to me, but I'm not really 100 percent sure.
(It may have landed in my spam filter, then.)

Here is a copy of my FILE321 (in TSO XMIT/RECEIVE format) with
the updates from John and Roland.Â  Note, Roland's changes
supersede John's.
